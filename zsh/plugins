# Which plugins would you like to load?
# Standard plugins can be found in ~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/*
# Custom plugins may be added to ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/
# Example format: plugins=(rails git textmate ruby lighthouse)
# Add wisely, as too many plugins slow down shell startup.

source /opt/homebrew/share/antigen/antigen.zsh

# Theme
antigen theme romkatv/powerlevel10k

# Caching bundles greatly improves performance:
# https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen/wiki/Commands

# Run the following to generate a cache of the bundles:
# antigen cache-gen

# makes use of caching:
# antigen init /path/to/.antigenrc
# .antigenrc contains Antigen configuration (bundle, bundles, theme)

# Then, on occasion, update bundles using:
# antigen update [<bundle-name>]
